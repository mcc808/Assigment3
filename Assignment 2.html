        <p>My passion for creating projects started at an early age. When middle school class was over,  my friends and I would go play video games. It was a mystery to me how games were created. However, it wasn't until later in my life that I actually delved into the software development involved in those games. That interest led to discovering other programming technologies such as java, c++ and python. I decided to go to college after my military service to learn computer science and engineering. At first, the subject was literally a foreign language but with hands on experince it became easier to grasp all the concepts. To date, I continue to learn and grow in the software development industry and hope to collaborate in rewarding projects in the near future.</p>
