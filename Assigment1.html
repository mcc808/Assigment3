    <h1> A little about me: </h1>
    <p>Today is the 7<sup>th</sup> day of the month of September. I enjoy the outdoors and although sometimes I can't get out much, I try to find other ways to stay busy or active. I am always aware of bringing H<sub>2</sub>O to stay hydrated. <b>I also have visited other countries</b> where I got the opportunity to learn about their <mark>cultures and traditions.</mark></p>

    <h2>Some of my favorite cuisines are <i>Thai, Japanese and Mexican.</i></h2>

    <h3>Thank you for reading! Have a <ins>wonderful day.</ins></h3>
